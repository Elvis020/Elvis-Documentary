
*  "the term "Unix" is used to describe a whole family of operating systems that all share the key basic ideas of Unix from the early days."


* "In Unix there are only two entities: files and processes."

[Hard - What is an OS]
*
 "OS: Software that sits on top of everything and manages everything "
 *

 [Medium - What is a Process?]
 **
 "A process is a  program in execution"
 "A process might invoke multi-processes"
 "The process makes a call into the operating system, causing operating system code to run on its behalf."
 " When this happens the process is said to be running in kernel mode."
 "The interaction layer between both the hardware and the software is catered by OS Kernels "

 [Medium -  Process State]
*  "Operating systems support the idea of multiple processes running concurrently. "

 * "A process is either ready, running or blocked."

 * "A process may be blocked because its waiting for something usually an input.i.e I/O process"

 * "multiprocessing, multitasking or time-sharing systems."


 [Medium -  Preemptive Multitasking]
 * "With preemptive multitasking the operating system takes full control of process scheduling."


 * "Processes are given a time period (often called a quantum since it is very short) in which to operate."

 * "Priority of a process changes over time."

 * (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_(Unix))


 [Medium -  Multiple Processors]
 * "Multiple processor (MP) machines are able to run more than one process at the same time. "

 *"A limitation of symmetrical multiprocessing is that the shared hardware resources, and especially memory, are points of contention."

 *"Symmetric multiprocessor systems usually have no more than 8 processors"
 "SMP: architecture where two or more identical processors are connected to a single, shared main memory, have full access to all input and output devices, and are controlled by a single operating system instance that treats all processors equally, reserving none for special purposes"

 *"true multiprocessor parallel machine may have tens of thousands of processors (TMC connection machine)."


 [Medium -  Multithreading]
 * "Modern operating systems support multithreading whereby a single process may have multiple concurrent threads of execution."

 *"Multithreaded processes are faster".
 * "A thread is contained in a process."
 * "Multithreaded programs increase application performance even on single processor machines".

 [Medium -  Memory Management]
 * "MM coordinates the allocation and sharing of memory."


 * "Another crucial job performed by the operating system is memory management"

 * "The total amount of memory that appears to be available for a process to use is called virtual memory. "

 * "Ram is usually limited."


 * "The memory manager is responsible for moving pages of processes into and out of memory as needed by the CPU."

 * "Every process has its own VM(Virtual memory: Ram + Disk)"

 [Medium -  Virtual and Physical Memory]
*"physical memory is divided into small units known as pages."

*"Memory allocation is not concurrent becuz of fragmentation."

[Medium -  File System Management]
* "FMS is like an inverted tree"
* "The file system manager is responsible for managing the long term storage facilities of the computer system"
* "The commands act thru the file system manager"
* "Note the unix commands to manipulate the file system."

[Medium -  Fetch Data from a file]
*" A hardware signal known as an interrupt is used to notify the operating system that the request has been completed.."

[Medium -  Device Drivers]
"Operating systems provide an abstract view of devices, that makes it easy to communicate with them. "
"This abstract view of devices is provided by a software module in the operating system called a device driver."
"Its job is to convert a common set of primitive operations into device specific functionality."

[Medium -  Distributed Services]
"They allow resource sharing."

[Medium -  What is Unix]
* "Allows users to run programs, mange theri own files and use devices"


[Medium -  Major Features]
*"Through a Unix shell (command line interpreter) collections of such commands are combined to perform complex tasks."


[Medium -  Unix and Linux]
* "The fundamental component of information in Unix is the byte stream."
* "Started in the 70s"
* "Debian(Ubuntu, Mint etc) is open-source"
* "Most servers are Linux-based and don't use GUI"

[Medium -  Unix/Linux Key Concepts]



[Medium -  Files and Processes]
* "In a unix sys, everything is either a file or a process."
* "Files are passive entities"
* "Processes are active entities"
* "Every process starts life as a file"


[Medium -  Organisation of Files]
*"Both process and file entities in Unix are organised as trees."
* "The root is denoted by a / "
"/usr/myDir - absolute path"
"usr/myDir - relative path"
*"However, the illusion maintained by the operating system, is that the file system is one, coherent, tree."
*"By convention, programs and devices exist in their own sub-directories, and users exist in their own sub-directories."


[Medium -  Organisation of Processes]
"All processes have a parent process and child processes"
* "The first process in a Unix system is called 'init' and it runs as part of the procedure of making the machine ready for users."
*" Once a user has logged in, a new child process is created to enable the user to enter commands. This process is called a shell."
*"There is a hierachy of running processes. Every process is a child process of a shell process when you log into a system."



[Medium -  Login]
* " In this process the system determines who the user is (the username), verifies this information (by requesting a password)."

*" During the login process the system associates a UID (user identity number corresponding to the username) and GID (group identity number corresponding to the user's default group) with the user. "

[Medium -  Users]
* "User is an attribute for a process or file."
* "In Unix, everything carries a UID and GID."


[Medium -  Structure of Unix]
*"The architectural structure of Unix/Linux is based on a series of layers"

*"The graphical representation of this is often described as the "onion diagram" as it can be imagined as a series of concentric rings"

* "Unix prevents applications from directly accessing this hardware by surrounding it with a low level layer of software known as the kernel."

*"The applications make use of the facilities provided by the system (hardware) through a well defined interface to the kernel, known as the system call interface."



[Medium -  Basic Commands]
*"cd and pwd dont create child processes"
*"commands like: whoami, date,who,ctrl+d-logout"
[Medium -  Keyboard Control]
"Every process sends a signal when it is finished."
[Medium -  File System Commands]
*"cat is an abbreviation for concatenate, meaning to append"

* "wc counts the number of words, lines and characters in the specified files. Using the optional '-l' argument, wc only displays the number of lines in the file."

"ps"

[Medium -  On-Line Manual]
"To get access to the flags of commands and maual use: man <command name>"


[Medium -  Command Format]
"Commands follow a standard format"
"The commands are case sensitive."

[Medium -  Unix Command Format]
"Examples of the commands include: 
ls -la
"
[Medium -  The Shell]
"Bourne shell - sh"
"Korn shell - ksh"
"C shell - csh"
"Bourne Again shell - bash"

"The Korn shell is currently the most popular shell."


[ Shell Wildcards]
"The ls f* command matches all file names which begin with f followed by any number of any character. "
"? matches any single character."
" and [ ] matches a range of specified characters."

[Medium -  I/O Redirection]
"By default the input for a command (if not taken from a supplied file) is read from the keyboard (the standard input)"
"The > indicates that the output should be written to the specified file."
"the < indicates that the input should be read from a specified file."
"the | symbol indicates that the output of the left command should be directed to the input of the right command."

[Medium - Displaying File Contents]
"more -  may be used to paginate contents"

[Medium - Displaying Parts of Files]
"head - displays the first lines of a file"
"tail - displays the last lines of a file"
"tail is more powerful than head because it is able to output the end of the file relative to the start or the end"


[Medium - Searching Files]
"Regular Expressions are templates for strings"

[Medium - Quoting]
"Allows characters to be hidden from the shell"

[Notes on Wildcard Expansion]
* "The purpose of the 'touch' command is not to create files but to update the timestamp on a file."
* "With touch, the creation of a file is a side-effect"
* "Typing * makes the shell do all the hardwork, perform an operation if any."
* "After pressing * and entering it, the shel tokenizes the line."
* "The * is a directive to the shell to expand all files in the current directory."
* "When you pass the *, it sees the first word as a command, and the rest as files and arguments."
*"Using the rm,sm,tm Example"




[User Management]
* "Consists of ID,group ID, password, username."
* "Physical memory consisits of pages. And it is allocated by the MMU."
* "The virtual address is then translated by MM to know the actual memory."

[File Management]
"Files and Directories"



[Revision]
* "What actually that, cp do: It creates a duplicate of the file to be copied"
* "What actually that, mv do: It links it to a different position."
"mv -i : the i flage prompts before removal."
"Inode:"

[Snippet 1]
* "Strings are not a primitive type in Java, its a class."
* "They are created using either String literals or String Objects."
* "In comparinging use .equals instead of ==, to compare value instead of a pointer."
* "Every class you declare inherits from Object(java.lang.Object)."
* "When an attribute is declared final it means its a constant"
* "Final used on a class, method and a variable means a different thing but the same idea."
*"With an abstract class, we cant instantiate it."
* "Once a method is declared abstract in a classs, whichever child class extends must declare it, otherwise an error will be created."



[Snippet 2]
*"After a class inheriting,it acn then be polymorphised."
* "In Java a class cannot do multiple inheritance, only single inheritance."
* "== in string comparison has to do with the memory location, while to .equals has to do with the value, they both do the same thing."
* "JVM never duplicates object in the String Pool"
* "You can have more than one interface.We use the implements keyword when using interfaces."
*"From java 8, we can provide default implementation in interfaces."
*"Implementation methods can be overided."
*"Interfaces can have static methods."
* "In C++, we could do .length() but it can be done in Java."
* "When passing an array in Java, you are passing a copy of the reference of the array."
*"Covariance: If S is a subtype of T, then the S[] is a subtype of T[]"
* "Enum is used when you want a limited number of instances of a specific class."
* "Enums in Java can be used in a swirtch-case statement"
*"Some annotations can either have values in them or not"
* "Collections in Java are interfaces."

[Snippet 3]
* "Collections are used with Generics"
*"Hashcode and equals are two methods on every class."
* "The hascode method is used with the equals method."
* "Hashcode return an integer number."
*"Lists provides an ordered list of objects."
* "There are so many types of collection, they include: List,ArrayList,Set,Queue"
* "HashSet and TreeSet are in the Set"
* "Queue: FIFO"
* "The Iterator includes: hasNext and Next methods fro iterator."
* "The Map interface is separate from the Collection interface."



[Miscellanous]
* "The intern method is to be used on Strings that are constructed with the new String() method."
* "The intern method inserts an variable into the String pool if its not already there."
* "The String method is immutable. i.e once its created, it cant be changed."
* "The String class has a number of methods that appear to modify strings but since strings are immutable, these methods just create and return a new string on the heap making it very memory inefficient."
* "This is where string Buffer and Builder comes in."
* "String buffer and StringBuilder are used where there is a need to make a loot of modifications to String characters"
*"Whenever you modify a string, a new object is created on the heap."

[Miscellanous 2]
*"String buffer is thread safe whereas StringBuilder is not."
* "Use StringBuilder whenever possible cuz its faster than StringBuffer"
* "For multi-threaded application, use String Buffer."
* "For single-threaded application, use String Builder."
* "Enum is a special data type that represents a grp of constants. Used with the enum keyword."
* "Field names of enum are written in Capital Letters."
* "Enums can be public,static and final.That is, they cannot be overidden."
* "Enum can be used to create objects and cannot extend other classes."
* "They should be used when you have values that cannot be changed."



[Miscellanous 3]
* "For primitive types, the  quick-sort algorithm is used."
* "For objects, the merge-sort algorithm is used."

[Notes from the C++ Linker Presentation]
* "When you run a C++ program, Compiling -> Linking -> Execution"
* "When external lib are referenced, it brings gaps after the compilation process."
* "Linkers find and collect symbols."
[is there a default type when linking occurs]
[relation with linking and the stack and the heap]
* "Dynamic linker makes use of a DSA called JumpTable."
* "nm <filename> "
* "ldd <filename>"
* "ls -l"
* "size <filename>"
* "When statically linked, has different segments in the address space."

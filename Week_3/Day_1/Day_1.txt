* "There were problems when developing large projects, that why these models were invented."
* "The business analysts were the point of contact with the clients, and the pass the information to the software architects. That was how it was done in the old days."
* "The waterfall model demonstrates this."
* "The "Waterfall Model" is the most traditional software development cycle used."

*"Testing is done b4 actually coding the functions and it is done on simple usecases."
* "TDD is characterized by the Test-Code-Refactor cycle"
* "Scrum can be applied in the XP process"
* "XP needs small teams (typically less than 10 developers) in a single location."
*"An unsupportive business unit and XP are not a good match."

* "Scrum is time boxed.Development takes place in sprints(10-20days)"
*"The Sprint Backlog is refined version of the Product backlog.It includes, illustrations and screenshots of products."

 [Deadlocks Snippet]
 * Deadlocks occur when two or more threads wait forever
 for a lock or resource held by another thread.

 * Deadlock is also the situation in which two or more competing actions are each
 waiting for the other to finish, and thus neve does.

 * Thread Starvation describes a situation where a thread is unable to gain regular access to shared
 resources and is unable to make progress. This happens when shared resources are made unavailable
 for long periods by "greedy" threads.

 * Deadlocks occur in DBs, when process A updates row 1 then row 2
 in the exact timeframe process B updates row 2 then row 1.


  [Livelock Snippet]
* Like two people attempting to pass each other in a narrow corridor,
A moves to his left to let B pass, while B moves to his right to let A pass.
They are still blocking each other.

* Livelock threads are unable to make any progress.

* hey are simply too busy responding to each other to resume work.


[How to avoid LL and DL]
* Using the trylock() method on the Lock interface.
* Making sure that each thread acquires the lock in the same order

# What are  INODES?
* Inodes contain the refernece count
* Fetch_execute Cycle: Fetch => Decode => Execute=> Return
* Pipelining in the CPU
* Slow Control
* Branch Predictor
* Scheduler
* DIfference between multithreading and Pipelining
* Multithreading is the way we write our code to improve the performance.
* Speculative execution*Getting instructions from a main memory and getting instructions from a cache.
* Lots if CPUs have stopped using spaculative Execution becuz it emits sensitive information.
